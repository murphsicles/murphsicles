## My GitHub Projects

Below are some featured public repositories I've contributed to or created. [View all my projects on GitHub](https://github.com/murphsicles?tab=repositories) (results below may be incomplete):

### [Galaxy](https://github.com/murphsicles/Galaxy)
**The Ultra High-Performance BSV Node.**

Galaxy is an ultra high-performance Bitcoin SV (BSV) node built in Rust, designed to unboundedly scale to asynchronously parallel process over 100,000,000 transactions per second (TPS) per shard. It leverages a microservices architecture with a novel asyncTCP implementation written from the ground-up for ultra-fast, asynchronous communication. Featuring a bespoke Tiger Beetle DB for scalable UTXO storage, and Rust SV for BSV-specific libraries to power OP_RETURN data, private blockchain overlays, and Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs.

### [RustBus](https://github.com/murphsicles/RustBus)
**The Legendary BSV Microservices Engine.** 

RustBus is a high-performance blockchain explorer, indexer and microservices engine for the BSV blockchain (BSV), engineered to far surpass traditional indexers with exceptional scalability and efficiency. Written in Rust, RustBus harnesses modern technologiesâ€”GraphQL, REST, WebSocket APIs, PostgreSQL partitioning, and ZeroMQâ€”to provide real-time transaction and block indexing for both mainnet and testnet. Ideal for developers querying BSV transactions, miners tracking blocks, or enterprises leveraging BSV's massive blockchain, RustBus is your premier solution.

### [nPrint](https://github.com/murphsicles/nPrint)
**A Bitcoin Script Virtual Machine (BSVM).**  

nPrint is a modern Rust framework for building, deploying, verifying, and interacting with smart contracts on the Bitcoin Script Virtual Machine (BSV). It supports a wide range of script types, media protocols, and asynchronous runtime operations, with a focus on modularity and efficiency.

### [axiom](https://github.com/murphsicles/axiom)
**A Rust library implementing a partition-tolerant distributed system with iterative consensus and economic incentives.**  

A Rust library implementing the framework from ["Resolving CAP Through Automata-Theoretic Economic Design"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02464) by Dr. Craig S. Wright. Axiom provides a partition-tolerant distributed system with iterative state updates, economic incentives, and provable convergence, designed for real-time applications.

### [rust-sv](https://github.com/murphsicles/rust-sv)
**A Rust library for working with the BSV Blockchain.**  

A Rust library for building Bitcoin SV applications and infrastructure, providing robust tools for P2P networking, address handling, transaction processing, and more.

### [paymail-rs](https://github.com/murphsicles/paymail-rs)

A fast, asynchronous Rust library for the BSV PayMail protocol, enabling seamless integration with Bitcoin SV services.

### [HOKG](https://github.com/murphsicles/HOKG)
**Hensel-Optimized Key Generation.**  

HOKG is a Rust library implementing the Hensel-Optimized Key Generation algorithm for elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). By leveraging Hensel's lemma, HOKG achieves up to 40% data efficiency in key generation, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments like IoT and edge devices. This library is efficient, secure, and built with modern Rust best practices.
