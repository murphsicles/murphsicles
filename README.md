## 📂 My GitHub Projects

Below are some featured public repositories I've contributed to or created. Dive in and explore! [View all my projects on GitHub](https://github.com/murphsicles?tab=repositories) (results below may be incomplete).  

### 🚀 [Galaxy](https://github.com/murphsicles/Galaxy)  
**The Ultra High-Performance BSV Node.**  

Galaxy is an ultra high-performance Bitcoin SV (BSV) node built in Rust, designed to unboundedly scale to asynchronously parallel process over 100,000,000 transactions per second (TPS) per shard. It leverages a microservices architecture with a novel asyncTCP implementation written from the ground-up for ultra-fast, asynchronous communication. Featuring a bespoke Tiger Beetle DB for scalable UTXO storage, and Rust SV for BSV-specific libraries to power OP_RETURN data, private blockchain overlays, and Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs.  

### ⚡ [RustBus](https://github.com/murphsicles/RustBus)  
**The Legendary BSV Microservices Engine.**  

RustBus is a high-performance blockchain explorer, indexer and microservices engine for the BSV blockchain (BSV), engineered to far surpass traditional indexers with exceptional scalability and efficiency. Written in Rust, RustBus harnesses modern technologies—GraphQL, REST, WebSocket APIs, PostgreSQL partitioning, and ZeroMQ—to provide real-time transaction and block indexing for both mainnet and testnet. Ideal for developers querying BSV transactions, miners tracking blocks, or enterprises leveraging BSV's massive blockchain, RustBus is your premier solution.  

### 🖨️ [nPrint](https://github.com/murphsicles/nPrint)  
**A Bitcoin Script Virtual Machine (BSVM).**  

nPrint is a modern Rust framework for building, deploying, verifying, and interacting with smart contracts on the Bitcoin Script Virtual Machine (BSV). It supports a wide range of script types, media protocols, and asynchronous runtime operations, with a focus on modularity and efficiency.  

### 🔄 [axiom](https://github.com/murphsicles/axiom)  
**A Rust library implementing a partition-tolerant distributed system with iterative consensus and economic incentives.**  

A Rust library implementing the framework from ["Resolving CAP Through Automata-Theoretic Economic Design"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02464) by Dr. Craig S. Wright. Axiom provides a partition-tolerant distributed system with iterative state updates, economic incentives, and provable convergence, designed for real-time applications.  

### 🔗 [rust-sv](https://github.com/murphsicles/rust-sv)  
**A Rust library for working with the BSV Blockchain.**  

A Rust library for building Bitcoin SV applications and infrastructure, providing robust tools for P2P networking, address handling, transaction processing, and more.  

### 💸 [paymail-rs](https://github.com/murphsicles/paymail-rs)  
A fast, asynchronous Rust library for the BSV PayMail protocol, enabling seamless integration with Bitcoin SV services.  

### 🔑 [HOKG](https://github.com/murphsicles/HOKG)  
**Hensel-Optimized Key Generation.**  

HOKG is a Rust library implementing the Hensel-Optimized Key Generation algorithm for elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). By leveraging Hensel's lemma, HOKG achieves up to 40% data efficiency in key generation, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments like IoT and edge devices. This library is efficient, secure, and built with modern Rust best practices.
